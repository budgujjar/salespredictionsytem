## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Sales Prediction System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed.
- Required Python packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction-system.git
cd sales-prediction-system
Download the necessary dataset from [data-source-url] and place it in the data/ directory.
Usage
To run the Sales Prediction System, follow these steps:

Preprocess the data:
bash
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
Train the prediction model:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Make predictions:
bash
Copy code
python predict_sales.py
View the results and insights in the output/ directory.
Data
Describe the data used in the system. Include details about data sources, format, and any data preprocessing steps. You can also mention if any external datasets were used.

Model
Explain the machine learning or statistical model used for sales prediction. Provide information about the algorithm, hyperparameters, and any model selection process.

Evaluation
Detail how the model's performance is evaluated. Include metrics used for evaluation, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared. Discuss the model's accuracy and any potential areas for improvement.

Deployment
Explain how the Sales Prediction System can be deployed in a production environment. Discuss any requirements or considerations for deployment, such as server setup, scalability, and real-time prediction capabilities.
